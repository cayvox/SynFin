# Synfin Quote & Swap‑Intent Standard (SQSS)

`Spec version: 0.3.0 (draft)` · `Status: working draft — RFC required for normative changes`

> Changes in `0.3.0` are driven by [RFC‑0002](../rfcs/0002-router-port-now-and-result.md): the
> `Router` contract takes a per‑call `now` and returns a typed `RouteResult` (§4.5, §10) instead
> of a bare `RoutePlan`.
>
> Changes in `0.2.0` are driven by [RFC‑0001](../rfcs/0001-assetid-minreceive-quote-linkage.md):
> the `AssetId` shape (§3), `minReceive > 0` (§4.1), the `Quote.quoteId` field (§4.3), and the
> redefined no‑overstatement + quote‑linkage rules (§4.4).

This is the **normative** specification. The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, and MAY are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119. This document builds directly on the **Canton Network Token Standard (CIP‑0056)** and does not redefine anything CIP‑0056 already provides; it composes it.

> Non‑normative material is marked *(note)*. Everything else is normative.

## 1. Scope & goals

SQSS defines a vendor‑neutral way to:

1. express a **swap intent** (what a taker wants),
2. request and represent **quotes** from venues, and
3. compose an **atomic, all‑or‑nothing settlement** of a multi‑leg route on Canton.

SQSS does **not** define: the routing optimization algorithm (pluggable; MAY be proprietary), pricing/oracles, custody, or any hosted service.

*(note)* The optimizer is intentionally out of scope so the standard stays neutral; an open reference router is provided in `@synfin/router-ref`.

## 2. Roles

- **Taker** — expresses a `SwapIntent`.
- **Venue** — a liquidity source that answers `QuoteRequest`s with `Quote`s and, for firm quotes, participates in settlement via CIP‑0056 allocations.
- **Router** — selects/splits quotes into a `RoutePlan`, returning a typed `RouteResult` (§4.5). Implements the `Router` port. The reference router is open; alternatives MAY be proprietary but MUST consume/produce the standard types.
- **Settlement coordinator** — the Daml application that drives the single atomic settlement transaction using CIP‑0056 allocation APIs.

## 3. Conventions

- **Asset identification.** An asset MUST be identified by a registry‑qualified instrument identifier consistent with CIP‑0056 (the issuing registry plus the instrument), never by symbol alone. An `AssetId` has exactly three fields:
  - `registry` — the issuing registry / token administrator identifier (the authority).
  - `instrumentId` — the instrument identifier within that registry.
  - `decimals` — a non‑negative integer, the instrument's precision.
  - `decimals` is **not authoritative on its own**: it MUST be consistent with the precision the issuing registry reports via the CIP‑0056 **token metadata API** (Appendix A). It is carried in `AssetId` only so off‑ledger validation works without global readable state (ARCHITECTURE.md §1, invariant #2); the registry remains the source of truth and `decimals` is its off‑ledger echo. Implementations SHOULD verify `decimals` against the registry's token metadata when available, and MUST reject quotes/intents whose amounts are inconsistent with the stated `decimals`.
- **Amounts** are exact decimals with the instrument's defined precision. Implementations MUST NOT use binary floating point for value math. An amount MUST NOT carry more fractional digits than its asset's `decimals`.
- **Rounding** MUST never overstate what the taker receives or understate what the taker gives. Where rounding is required, it MUST be applied in the taker's favor or rejected.
- **Time** is UTC. Deadlines and validity are absolute timestamps.
- **Basis points (bps):** 1 bps = 0.01%.

## 4. Data model (normative shapes)

*(note)* Types are shown in TypeScript‑like form for clarity. The authoritative schemas are JSON Schema in `@synfin/spec`; on‑ledger shapes are Daml interfaces. Off‑ledger HTTP shapes are described with OpenAPI, mirroring CIP‑0056's "Daml interface + OpenAPI" convention.

### 4.1 SwapIntent

```
SwapIntent {
  intentId:        string         // unique; replay/idempotency key
  taker:           PartyId        // Canton party
  give:            { asset: AssetId, amount: Decimal }
  want:            { asset: AssetId, minReceive: Decimal }   // floor the taker accepts; MUST be > 0
  maxSlippageBps:  integer        // additional protection vs reference; >= 0
  deadline:        Timestamp      // absolute expiry; settlement MUST NOT occur after
  constraints?:    IntentConstraints
}
IntentConstraints {
  maxVenues?:      integer        // optional cap on number of legs
  venueAllowList?: VenueId[]      // optional restriction
  privacy?:        "strict"       // default strict: no leg may learn the aggregate
}
```

- `minReceive` is authoritative and MUST be strictly greater than 0; a non‑positive floor is invalid and MUST be rejected at validation (RFC‑0001 Decision B). `maxSlippageBps` is an additional guard relative to an agreed reference; it MUST NOT relax `minReceive`.
- A settlement that would deliver less than `minReceive` MUST fail.

### 4.2 QuoteRequest

```
QuoteRequest {
  intentRef:   string        // intentId
  give:        { asset: AssetId, amount: Decimal }   // size for THIS request (a bucket)
  want:        { asset: AssetId }
  deadline:    Timestamp
  nonce:       string        // replay protection
}
```

- A Router MAY issue multiple `QuoteRequest`s per intent at different sizes ("buckets") to estimate depth. A Venue MUST treat each request independently.
- A Venue MUST NOT be able to derive the taker's total intent from a single `QuoteRequest` (privacy, §7).

### 4.3 Quote

```
Quote {
  quoteId:     string             // unique id set by the venue/adapter; unique within an intent's quote round
  venueId:     VenueId
  give:        { asset: AssetId, amount: Decimal }   // echoes requested size
  receive:     { asset: AssetId, amount: Decimal }   // offered output
  feeBps:      integer            // fees already reflected in `receive`; declared for transparency
  sourceKind:  "AMM" | "CLOB" | "RFQ"
  firmness:    "indicative" | "firm"
  validUntil:  Timestamp
  commitment?: CommitmentRef      // REQUIRED if firmness == "firm"
  signature?:  Signature          // REQUIRED if firmness == "firm"
}
```

- `quoteId` MUST be present and unique within the scope of an intent's quote‑gathering round; it is the identifier a `RouteLeg.quoteRef` resolves to (§4.4, RFC‑0001 Decision C).
- An **indicative** quote is non‑binding. A **firm** quote MUST be backed by a `commitment` that can be honored on‑ledger during settlement, and MUST be signed by the venue.
- Consumers MUST reject quotes where `validUntil` has passed, where amounts are non‑positive, where decimals/units are inconsistent with the instrument, or (for firm) where the signature/commitment does not verify.

### 4.4 RoutePlan

```
RoutePlan {
  intentRef:        string
  legs:             RouteLeg[]
  aggregateReceive: Decimal       // sum of expected leg receipts
  worstCaseReceive: Decimal       // lower bound given quote firmness/slippage
  slippageBps:      integer       // vs reference; MUST satisfy intent.maxSlippageBps
}
RouteLeg {
  venueId:  VenueId
  give:     { asset: AssetId, amount: Decimal }
  receive:  { asset: AssetId, amount: Decimal }
  quoteRef: string               // MUST equal the quoteId of a Quote returned for this intent
}
```

- The sum of `legs[].give.amount` MUST equal `intent.give.amount` (conservation).
- No `RouteLeg` may reference a venue excluded by `venueAllowList`, and `legs.length` MUST respect `maxVenues`.
- A `RoutePlan` whose `worstCaseReceive` < `intent.want.minReceive` MUST NOT be submitted for settlement.
- **Quote linkage (RFC‑0001 Decision C).** Each `RouteLeg.quoteRef` MUST equal the `quoteId` of an actual `Quote` returned for the same intent. A `RoutePlan` MUST NOT contain a leg whose `quoteRef` does not resolve to a known quote.
- **No overstatement (RFC‑0001 Decision C).** For every leg, against the quote it references:
  - `leg.receive.amount` MUST NOT exceed that quote's `receive.amount`;
  - the referenced quote MUST be unexpired at plan‑construction time (`now <= quote.validUntil`);
  - the quote's `give.asset` and `receive.asset` MUST match the leg's.
  In addition (kept from prior versions), `aggregateReceive` MUST NOT exceed the sum of `legs[].receive.amount`, and rounding MUST never favor the protocol over the taker (§3). Checking these requires access to the set of source quotes and the current time.

### 4.5 Router contract and RouteResult (RFC‑0002)

A `Router` consumes a `SwapIntent`, the `Quote`s gathered for it, and the current time, and produces either a `RoutePlan` or a typed no‑viable‑route outcome:

```
route(intent: SwapIntent, quotes: Quote[], now: Timestamp) -> RouteResult

RouteResult =
  | { ok: true,  plan: RoutePlan }
  | { ok: false, reason: NoViableRouteReason }

NoViableRouteReason =
  | "no-eligible-quotes"       // no quote matched the intent's assets / was unexpired at now / allowed
  | "min-receive-unreachable"  // no plan reaches want.minReceive (includes insufficient depth)
  | "slippage-exceeded"        // the best plan would exceed intent.maxSlippageBps
```

- `now` MUST be a **per‑call** parameter. A Router MUST NOT bind the evaluation time to a long‑lived instance or read an internal clock; this keeps routing pure and deterministic (ARCHITECTURE.md §1 invariant #5) and lets it enforce the time‑dependent no‑overstatement rule of §4.4 (a leg's referenced quote MUST be unexpired at `now`).
- A Router MUST signal the absence of a viable plan by returning `{ ok: false, reason }`. It MUST NOT throw to signal no‑route, and it MUST NOT return a `RoutePlan` that violates the §4.4 constraints. When `ok` is `true`, the `plan` MUST satisfy every §4.4 constraint.
- `RouteResult` and `NoViableRouteReason` are off‑ledger interface types; they are **not** wire messages and are not defined by JSON Schema. *(note)* `RouteResult` is expressed as a TypeScript type in `@synfin/spec`.

## 5. Off‑ledger quote API (Venue interface)

A Venue exposes a quote endpoint. Normatively:

- `POST /quote` accepts a `QuoteRequest` and returns a `Quote` (or a typed rejection).
- Responses MUST be returned before `QuoteRequest.deadline`; late responses MUST be ignored by the consumer.
- The endpoint MUST be stateless with respect to taker identity beyond what is required to price the requested size.

*(note)* Adapters in `@synfin/adapters` wrap each venue's native API into this interface. An adapter MUST be pure/deterministic in normalization and MUST pass the conformance suite.

## 6. On‑ledger settlement (atomic split execution)

Settlement composes the route into CIP‑0056 allocation workflows.

1. For each `RouteLeg`, the settlement coordinator creates an **allocation request** (CIP‑0056 `allocation request` API) for the taker's `give` on that leg and for the venue's corresponding `receive`.
2. Once **all** allocations for all legs are in place, the coordinator executes a **single Daml transaction** that settles every leg (CIP‑0056 DvP). Either all legs settle or none do.
3. The settlement transaction MUST enforce, on‑ledger:
   - total delivered to the taker ≥ `intent.want.minReceive`;
   - `intent.maxSlippageBps` not exceeded;
   - current time ≤ `intent.deadline`.
4. If any condition fails or any allocation is missing/expired, the transaction MUST abort and no leg settles.

Constraints:

- **Same synchronizer.** All input contracts in the settlement transaction MUST be on the same synchronizer (CIP‑0056 requirement). A route that would require legs on different synchronizers MUST NOT be settled atomically; it MUST be rejected.
- **Allocation expiry.** Allocations carry a validity window; expired allocations MUST be released and MUST NOT settle.
- **Single‑use.** An allocation MUST NOT be reusable across settlements (no double‑spend).
- **Idempotency.** `intentId` makes settlement idempotent; a retry MUST NOT cause a second settlement.

*(note)* This mirrors the proven pattern from CIP‑0056 (e.g., CantonSwap's first cross‑issuer atomic swap, Oct 2025) — SQSS generalizes it to N legs across multiple venues.

## 7. Privacy model (normative)

- A Venue MUST learn only its own leg: the assets and amounts of that leg. It MUST NOT learn the aggregate intent, other legs, or the route.
- Implementations MUST NOT expose cross‑leg correlation to any venue or third party.
- Settlement details MAY be disclosed to authorized parties (auditor/regulator) via **selective disclosure**; they MUST NOT be public.
- *(note)* Because routing and amounts are not in a public mempool, front‑running/MEV is structurally mitigated. Implementations still MUST avoid leaking intent via timing or side channels.

## 8. Firmness, validity, replay

- Consumers MUST enforce `validUntil` and reject stale quotes.
- `QuoteRequest.nonce` and `SwapIntent.intentId` provide replay protection; settlement MUST reject a replayed intent.
- Firm quotes MUST be honored during their validity or the settlement aborts; a venue that fails to honor a firm commitment MUST be de‑prioritized by conformant routers *(note: enforcement/penalty policy is implementation‑defined)*.

## 9. Versioning & capability negotiation

- SQSS is versioned with SemVer. Wire messages carry the spec MAJOR.MINOR they target.
- Consumers MUST ignore unknown optional fields (forward compatibility) and MUST NOT require fields introduced in a later MINOR.
- Breaking changes (MAJOR) follow the RFC process (GOVERNANCE.md §5).

## 10. Conformance

An implementation is **SQSS‑conformant** if:

- (Venue/adapter) it implements §5 and §4.3 and passes the adapter conformance suite (golden + fuzz);
- (Router) it implements the §4.5 contract — `route(intent, quotes, now)` returning a typed `RouteResult` — consuming §4.3 quotes and producing §4.4 plans that honor all §4 constraints, and signaling no‑viable‑route as a typed value (never by throwing). It MUST route when a quote set demonstrably satisfies the intent;
- (Settlement) it implements §6 and passes the Daml Script settlement suite (§ all‑or‑nothing, abort/expiry, single‑use, bound enforcement);
- (Wallet) it can create allocations per CIP‑0056 in response to SQSS allocation requests.

Conformance is verified by the suite described in TESTING.md §5.

## 11. Security considerations

See [THREAT_MODEL.md](../../THREAT_MODEL.md). Summary of normative requirements: validate all quotes as untrusted input; enforce economic bounds on‑ledger; guarantee atomicity and single‑use allocations; preserve privacy; reject cross‑synchronizer atomic routes; protect against replay via nonce/intentId.

## 12. Out of scope

Routing optimization algorithm, pricing/oracles, custody, hosted services, and any non‑Canton settlement. SQSS defines the interfaces these integrate with and the open reference behaviour only.

### Appendix A — Relationship to CIP‑0056

SQSS uses, and does not replace, CIP‑0056's six APIs — chiefly **holdings** (inventory), **allocation**, **allocation request**, and **allocation instruction** (atomic DvP). It also relies on CIP‑0056's **token metadata API** as the source of truth for an instrument's precision: an `AssetId.decimals` (§3) is the off‑ledger echo of that metadata and MUST be consistent with it. SQSS adds the **quote/intent** layer above these and the **multi‑leg atomic composition** pattern. Any conflict between this document and CIP‑0056 is resolved in favor of CIP‑0056, and is a bug in this spec to be fixed via RFC.
